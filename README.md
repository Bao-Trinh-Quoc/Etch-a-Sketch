# Etch-a-Sketch
Mini project I did to practice my DOM JVS skills.

https://bao-trinh-quoc.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/
Features:
- something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. (Click the link above :) )
- randomize the squaresâ€™ RGB values with each interaction (hover)
- implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%
